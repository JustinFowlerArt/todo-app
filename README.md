## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS Superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Styles

### What I learned

This was a nice refresher on implementing CRUD actions in React. I also learned how to create a drag and drop list in React without external libraries.

### Useful resources

- [Drag and Drop in React without using any External Library](https://www.aurigait.com/blog/drag-and-drop-in-react/) - Very helpful in explaining the logic behind drag events in React and how to implement them.
- [Creating a Drag and Drop List with React Hooks](https://dev.to/florantara/creating-a-drag-and-drop-list-with-react-hooks-4c0i) - Useful for styling the element that will be moved after dropping.
